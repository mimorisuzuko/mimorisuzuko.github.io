  abstract   = {The dual Gaussian distribution hypothesis has been used to predict the success rate of target pointing on touchscreens. Bi and Zhai evaluated their success-rate prediction model in off-screen-start pointing tasks. However, we found that their prediction model could also be used for on-screen-start pointing tasks. We discuss the reasons why and empirically validate our hypothesis in a series of four experiments with various target sizes and distances. The prediction accuracy of Bi and Zhai's model was high in all of the experiments, with a 10-point absolute (or 14.9% relative) prediction error at worst. Also, we show that there is no clear benefit to integrating the target distance when predicting the endpoint variability and success rate.},

  abstract   = {In touch interfaces, a target, such as an icon, has two widths: the visual width and
                the touchable width. The visual width is the target's appearance, and the touchable
                width is the area in which users can touch a target and execute an action. In this
                study, we conduct two experiments to investigate the effects of the visual and touchable
                widths on touch pointing performance (movement time and success rate). Based on the
                results, we build candidate models for predicting the movement time and compare them
                by the values of adjusted R^2 and AIC. In addition, we build a success rate model
                and test it through cross-validation. Existing models can be applied only to situations
                where the visual and touchable widths are equal, and we show that our refined model
                achieves better model fitness, even when such widths are different. We also discuss
                the design implications of the touch interfaces based on our models.},
